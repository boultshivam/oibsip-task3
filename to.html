<p>Why is it important to have a To Do list?
  One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organised. When you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When you've got a clear outline of the tasks you've got to do and those you've completed, it helps you stay focused.</p>
    <div class="header">
      <h2 >To Do List</h2>
      <input type="text" id="myInput" placeholder="Task">
      <span onclick="newe()" class="addBtn">Add</span>
    </div><h1>incomplete task</h1>

    <ul id="uli">
      <li class="checked">go</li>
    </ul>
    <button type="button" id="clear-list" onclick="removeAll()">Clear</button>
<h1>completed task</h1>
    <script src="ts.js"></script>
